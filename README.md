Exercise 1 -- UI Widget

Create the CSS and HTML for a UI widget.

Requirements:

In the zip, there are two screen captures. One for small screens, one for large screens. On small screens, you only see the info box. On large screens, you will also see the map.
On large screens the map pin is centered horizontally and vertically over the map. The info box should sit just above the map pin. The maximum width for the widget is 460px wide. 
We've provided SVGs for the O3 logo, phone icon and map pin. However, you may need to resize them. 
The font is Lato and can be loaded from Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato).
